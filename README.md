# Sorting Algorithm Self-Implementation

Here, I will be implementing sorting algorithms completely on my own. I will be using other resources when I need to; however, I want to think through the algorithms and translate the pseudocode like a programmer actually would.

## Level 1 Sorts:

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bogosort

## Level 2 Sorts:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heapsort

## Level 3 Sorts:

- Radix Sort
- Timsort


(Based on what I know about these sorts, the list may be subject to change.)
